            <p>🌟 1. Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C) and prepare a cupcake pan with cupcake liners.</p>
            <p>🌟 2. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium sized bowl and set aside.</p>
            <p>🌟 3. In a large bowl, whisk the melted butter, sugar and vanilla extract together until well combined.</p>
            <p>🌟 4. Add the eggs and whisk together until well combined.</p>
            <p>🌟 5. Add the sour cream and whisk together until well combined.</p>
            <p>🌟 6. Add the milk and whisk together until well combined.</p>
            <p>🌟 7. Add the dry ingredients and whisk together until combined, but do not over mix.</p>
            <p>🌟 8. Fold in the chopped strawberries.</p>
            <p>🌟 9. Fill the cupcake liners a little more than half full and bake for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>
            <p>🌟 10. Remove cupcakes from the oven and place on a cooling rack to cool.</p>
            <p>🌟 11. To make the strawberry buttercream, make the strawberry reduction. Add the strawberries to a food processor or blender and puree until smooth. You should have about 3/4 cups of puree.</p>
            <p>🌟 12. Add the puree to a small sized saucepan and cook over medium heat. Allow the mixture to come to a slow boil, stirring consistently to keep it from burning, until it has thickened and reduced to about 6 tbsp, about 10-15 minutes. To measure, pour the puree into a measuring cup. If it’s more than 6 tbsp (between 1/4 and 1/2 cup), add it back to the pan and continue cooking.</p>
            <p>🌟 13. When the puree has thickened and reduced, pour into a large measuring cup and allow to cool to at least room temperature. This strawberry mixture can be made ahead, if you like, and stored in the fridge.</p>
            <p>🌟 14. Add the butter to a large mixer bowl and beat until smooth.</p>
            <p>🌟 15. Carefully add about half of the powdered sugar and mix until smooth and well combined.</p>
            <p>🌟 16. Add 4 tablespoons of the strawberry reduction, vanilla extract and the salt to the frosting and mix until well combined.</p>
            <p>🌟 17. Add the remaining powdered sugar and mix until smooth. Add additional strawberry reduction as needed to get the right consistency and flavor.</p>
            <p>🌟 18. Pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes. Decorate with a strawberry half, if desired.</p>
